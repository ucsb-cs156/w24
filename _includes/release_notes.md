# Release Notes

You are required to prepare a set of release notes as a team.

You may prepare these in one of two ways:
* As a Google Drive document in your Drive folder called `Release Notes` (in the same folder where your retros go), OR
* In Markdown format in a file `/docs/release_notes.md` in a new branch of your repo called `release_notes`. If you choose this route, make a Pull Request for this change (the normal PR deadline doesn't apply to this PR).

The choice is up to you: each method has its pros and cons; do whatever seems easiest to you.

## What goes in the release notes

The release notes should summarize:
* For the actual *users* of the application, a summary of what changes they notice from the way the app was at the start of the course to now.
* In a separate, shorter section: for the *developers* of the application, a summary of any additional changes devs may need to be aware of.
* It does not have to be every single last detail of every change; it should focus on the big picture of things users/developers would need or want to know. 
* Before and after screenshots can be helpful.

For more information, see this section of the lecture notes from M23:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/lectures/week07b/#brief-discussion-of-release-notes>

## How to submit

Work colletively on this as a team.   When finished, submit a link to either your Google Drive doc, or to your PR on Canvas under the assignment `ReleaseNotes`

For the due date, refer to the Release Notes assignment on Canvas.
