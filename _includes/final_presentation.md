# Notes about the final presentation

The final presentation should be a team effort, and should highlight all of the PRs that got merged into the main branch.

Make a video of between 5-8 minutes (see guidelines below) and submit the link on Gauchospace.

Limit your presentation to 5-8 minutes.   8 minutes is a hard upper limit.

Highlight the work *from an end user perspective first*.

That is:
* The best thing is to show how an end user would use the feature
* The next best thing is to show either a front or backend component in isolation, for example:
  - If there is a front end component that is not active in the app yet, you can show it in Storybook
  - If there is a backend API, but the functionality isn't available in the user interface yet, you can demo it in Swagger.
* Show internals of code only after explaining the user facing functions, and even then, only if you have left over time.

  
# Instructions for your video:

Here's a tutorial [video on making demo videos from CS48 S20](https://youtu.be/k0Je8ASh4jo) (Video inception)

Based on the experience of CS48 students, **pre-recording is strongly recommended**.  You will *know for sure* in advance whether the
demo is successful, and whether or not you've hit the target length of 5-8 minutes.

Your video should be 5 to 8 minutes long, and cover these points:

* First, mention the names of the members of the team, and introduce the person narrating the video.  
  - It is ok if all the team members appear in the video.  It is also ok if only one person narrates the video on behalf of the team.
* Second, go through each of the features that your team worked on that were merged into `main`
  - Only demo the features that were merged into `main`
  - Focus in this part of the video on demoing the features from a *user perspective*, not on the technical details of how they were implemented.
* Next, if there is time remaining to reach the 5-10 minute mark, you may briefly cover any technical and/or non-technical challenges your team faced
  - You don't have to cover everything.  
  - You don't really even have to include this part if your demo already hits the 5-10 minute range.
  - If you do include this part, focus on the items that you think would be interesting to the audience (fellow students in CS156 M23, and the staff of CS156 M23, and potential users of the software you worked on). 
  - Possible items to include
    - Particularly interesting technical details of what you had to write in the code
    - Challenges in testing
    - Challenges in team communication and organization, and what you did to overcome those
* Optional: at the end, if you like, you may thank anyone that was particularly helpful to the team from the staff (TAs and LAs, or students from other teams). 
  - Please don't include thanks to me (Prof. Conrad) in the video; I don't want this to be an exercise in brown-nosing.
  - If you do want to express gratitude, feel free to share your thoughts with me on the Slack, by email, etc.  

Please then also poll your team members and come to a consensus about the privacy of your final video. Include this in your submission on Canvas.
