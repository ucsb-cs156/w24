# Announcements

HW02 is due TONIGHT 2/7 at midnight. 

`team03` is due at midnight a week from tomorrow, i.e. Thursday 2/15.  Aim for then.
* The grace period is through that weekend (which is a three-day weekend; there are no classes on Monday 2/19), i.e. the final day/time to submit on Canvas is 11:59pm Monday 2/19.
* That allows us to start the legacy code projects on Tuesday 2/20.

# Today
* Standup on team02 if not done
* When done with team02, start team03
