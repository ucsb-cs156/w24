# Start with a standup

Each team member should make a standup update on slack, and in person (or over zoom)

Then work on finishing up team03.

# Team03 deadline

The goal is to finish submission of team03 by midnight Friday 2/16.

There is a "grace period" until midnight Monday 2/19.

However, that second deadline is strict; we must pivot to the legacy code projects beginning next Tuesday.

# But what if you don't finish?

My hope is that your team doesn't experience any grief related to team03, that you finish it before Monday 2/19 11:59pm.

But if your team still has unfinished work by then, you need to just submit what you have and hope for the best partial credit you can get.

That may lead some of you to the five stages of grief described by [Kubler-Ross](https://www.psycom.net/stages-of-grief):
* Denial: just continuing to work on team03 and ask for help with team03 even though the class has moved on
* Anger: expressions of disbelief that we aren't giving you more time, lashing out at team members, TAs, LAs, the instructor, the Chancellor, the Regents, etc.
* Bargaining: saying that you'll do this or that, if only we give you one more day on team03
* Depression: just wanting to give up on the whole class
* Acceptance: realizing that the legacy code project is 25% of your grade, while team03 is probably around 4% of your grade, and that it would be better to shift your energies.

This last point is the one I want to stress: 25% is much, much bigger than 4%.
* Stealing time from the assignment worth 25% of your grade to focus on the one worth 4% of your grade is a bad plan.
* So, let's try not to end up there.
