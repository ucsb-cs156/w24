# Today: retro4

Please look in the usual spot (gdrive link on your slack channel) for the retro4 worksheet.

This retro is a little different from the rest, in the sense that it is a sort of "exit interview" for the team.

There is no further work ahead of the team, so instead of focusing on how the team can improve, it is focused more on
what learnings from your time together you'll take with you to future work on team software development projects.
Other than that, it's like any other retro.
