# Agenda for section on Friday July 21

(This was posted on the announcements channel on the slack; I'm updating it here so we have a record of what was done that day).

If finished with team01:

* Start team02: divide up the six database tables among your team in your slack channel (Dining Commons, UCSB Org, Rec Request, Menu Item, Help Req, Articles)
* Find the card for creating the table you were assigned to, assign to self, and drag into in progress
* Start working

If not done with team01:
* Standup, and Kanban board review (as yesterday)
* Try to finish by midnight tonight if possible.
