* Go over some details about how to approach team01
  - Managing branches
  - Managing Pull Requests
  - Why you should *freeze* a branch once you do a PR from it
* Discuss what a "standup meeting is" 
* Hold our first "standup meeting"

We'll then continue work on team01.

# Some Details about team01

* We started out in pairs as a way to getting organized.
* HOWEVER, once your pair is finished, you should pivot to helping the other members of your team.
* You can offer to help with code reviews, pair programming, etc.

# Once you make a PR,  THEN LEAVE THAT BRANCH ALONE.   

Don't continue working on a branch if there's an open pull request for it--unless you are fixing things that are pointed out in a code review.

Instead, make a new branch off of the old branch.

For example, if you have a PR from the `Chris-Form` branch that adds the form you need for the `Chris-CreatePage` branch, do this:


```
git checkout Chris-Form
git pull origin Chris-Form
git checkout -b Chris-CreatePage
```


# What happens if you continue making changes to your branch after you do a PR?

Remember that: 
* A branch is a pointer to a commit
* A PR is a request to pull from one branch into another
* Every time you make a commit to a branch, you update where that branch points
* Meaning: if you continue to make commits to a branch that is the basis of an open PR, that *PR will continue to change*
* That's not good!  You want a PR to be a fixed target.
  - You change the branch that a PR is pointing to if and only if the code review process suggests you need changes
  - Then, branches that branched off of that will need to be *rebased*
  - Rebasing means: clipping off all of the later commits that came after the *old* base, and reapplying them *on top of* the new base.


# What is a Standup meeting?

In a standup meeting, each team member should briefly share, *both* by posting in the slack channel, *and* by saying it out loud for the group assembled and the zoom room, these three things: 

1. What have you done **since the last time** the team met? 
2. What are you **doing now**? 
   - What issue are you currently assigned to in the "in Progress" column on the Kanban board (hopefully its only one)?
   - How is it going?
3. Are you **blocked** on anything?

A fourth question is sometimes added: 

* When do you think you will be **finished** and ready to take on a new issue?

The main purposes of a standup are to:
* Identify blockers so they can be eliminated
* Ensure that each member of the team can make progress between now and the next standup

# Standup DOs and DON'Ts

DO:

* Keep it short (physically standing isn't required, but it can help)
* Give other team members your full attention
* Offer help with blockers (but summary, and promises to follow up, NOT detailed explanations)
* Keep it positive

DON'T:
* Go into *detailed* explanations; instead make a note to follow up with those *after* standup is over
* Be late or skip standup.
* Bring up extraneious issues unless they are blockers (blocking immediate progress)

# Standup are not the only meetings!

A standup should not be the only kind of team meeetings that you have.   

* Your team may need to have other kinds of discussions!
* If the thing you want to discuss doesn't fit into the "formula", suggest to the team that you have a different kind of discussion before or after standup.
* Try to keep standup focused, short, and structured.

# Now do your standup, then review your Kanban board as a team

* Each team member, please take a moment to answer the three questions on your Slack channel
  - This is not always done; on real world agile teams
  - We are doing it here to help you get used to the process
  - It also allows the staff to check that everyone is participating (since this is a university course, not a company).  
* Then, go around and have each team member make an oral report to the team 
  - This is the part that's more authentic to real world practice
  - That's why I want you to really, really do it.
  - Ask for a volunteer to go first.
  - Then each person gives their report, and then identifies who goes next.
  - While sharing, each person should ideally unmute (if they are on zoom, or any team member is on zoom) and turn on their camera while sharing.
  - When done, signify who should go next.

# Review your Kanban board as a team

Then, review your kanban board as a team.   

This is not always done during Standup meetings, but it's a good practice.

* Make sure each team member has something in the in-progress column on the kanban board. (Unless they are done with both of their issues, and there are no team level issues left to take care of--in that case, they should help with code reviews.)
* Take care of any code review requests, and merge code that's ready to merge.
* Do not merge code that doesn't pass the CI/ checks; only merge branches that are "green on CI".


# Work on team01

Then, you'll just work as a team or in pairs, individually or in mobs as needed, while getting help from the staff.

# Today's participation activity

We may or may not assign a grade for today's participation, but if we do, this will be the basis:

* 50% did the student make a standup post in the slack channel?
* 50% do they have a story in the in-progress column on the Kanban board?

# Staff members:

Please check the Kanban boards for the three teams to which you are assigned.  Check that:

* Each team member has exactly one issue assigned to them in the In Progress column (not less than one, not more than one)
* If there are issues "In Review", check that there is a Pull Request
* If there are issues that are "Done", if applicable, be sure that a PR has been merged
