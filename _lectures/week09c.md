Final Pull Requests for legacy code projects are due by 5pm today.

Each of those should be green on CI and code reviewed by a team member by 6:15pm today.

Any PRs not in that state by 6:15pm today *might not be reviewed and merged by staff* in time to count towards your project grade.

After 6:15pm today, the only work accepted for credit will be work necessary to get those remaining PRs merged (e.g. responding to peer and/or staff code reviews.)

# If your team is already at 100 points

You can start on your team's final video presentation and the release notes for your work (see below).  You can also read about the final exam.
