# Announcements

On Tuesday of next week, we'll:
* do a retro 2
* give you some things to look at for the legacy code projects after class
* then officially get started with them on Wednesday.

# What to do today:

* Each team member, please do a written standup update in your slack channel.  You can do these updates at any time starting from now up until your scheduled section time.
* Please meet in person or on zoom during the first 10 minutes of your scheduled discussion time (or at the very least, check in on Slack during those 10 minutes) to do two things:
  1. An out loud standup
  2. Scrum Master functions (is everyone assigned an issue? are issues moving across the board? has anything been "in review" for more than 24 hours without a code review?  Is anything ready to be merged?).
Then, it's just working on your issues and getting help from the staff.
