# What to do today:

* Each team member, please do a written standup update in your slack channel.  You can do these updates at any time starting from now up until your scheduled section time.
* Begin familiarizing yourself with the legacy code project to which you have been assigned.
  * See the following for team repo assignments: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w24/lab/project.html>
  * You can access the staff deployment of these apps via the initial links in the README.md of your team's repo.
* Create your team's deployment of the app, and begin to familiarize yourself with the codebase.
* Begin familiarizing yourself with the issues in the repo, and the project board. Things to consider include:
  * What order should you tackle the issues?
    * Ideally you should start with easier issues to familiarize yourself with the codebase before working yourself up to the more difficult issues.
  * Who would like to work on what issues? (You can use the "assignee" feature in github to assign issues to yourself, or to others on your team.)
    * You can work together on issues too, especially on the difficult ones.
