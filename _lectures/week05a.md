# Announcements

* There is a new homework assignment, [H01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/hwk/h01/)
* This will provide a brief introduction to JavaScript before we start team03, coming soon, where we start to work with the frontend
  
# Ten minute standup 2:01pm-2:11pm

* Do a written update on the slack channel
* Do an out loud standup
* Signal on #help-lecture-discussion that your team is done (by team number, not table number)
  - If all teams finish before 2:11pm, we'll continue earlier.

# Database tips: 2:11pm- 2:15pm

* How to reset the db on localhost: `mvn clean`
* [How to reset the db on dokku](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/postgres_database.html#resetting-the-database) 
* When should I do this?
  - If you are getting strange `SQL` errors in your backend console output
  - Especially if you get these after making a change to an `@Entity` class.

In real world applications, this is done with something called *database migration frameworks*.

That's a topic we've tried to introduce into this course a few times (unsuccessfully so far).

If someone would like to take on a CMPSC 192 or CMPSC 196 independent study on this topic in Fall, let me know.

# Agile Retrospective Intro (2:20-2:40)

# Today (outline)

The most important aspect of Agile: The Retrospective

We "inspect and adapt".

* Pause all work/submission for team02/team03.
* Focus only on the retro, and do not rush through it.
* A retro that lasts less than 30 minutes raises questions about whether it is a good faith effort.
* Give it the time that it needs.

# Where did Agile come from?

* The old Waterfall method didn't work well: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm>
* During the 90s, folks inspected and adapted, leading to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

# Retrospective: the heart of Agile

The core principle of Agile is "inspect and adapt".  
* It was "inspecting and adapting" that led the original authors of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) to their ideas.
* It has been by "inspecting and adapting" that the Agile philosophy continues to grow and develop.

Inspect and Adapt is, in many ways, linked to the *Scientific Method*; 
* we observe
* we form a hypothesis
* we do an experiment

All in the service of doing a better job of software development.

In a retro, the team stops, pauses, reflects, and most importantly *comes up with an actionable change* for their practice.

# Today's Retro (2:40 - 3:15)

* Start by having everyone take 5 minutes to read through this article: [https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html)
  - Really read it!  It has the instructions for the most important activity in today's class
 
* Then take 5 minutes to read your fellow team members feedback (login to <https://catme.org>)
 
* Next, choose a leader for your retro. It should be someone that has read the instructions and is comfortable leading the group. 
* Then, locate the Google Drive folder for your team.  It should be linked in your Slack channel with a `gdrive` link this:

<img width="260" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/166498621-8fc7d61a-4d76-404d-9514-ea4672667ad9.png">

Check that each member of the team is able to access the folder.

In that folder, create a folder called `Retros` and in that folder, create a document `Retro1`

Then follow the instructions in the [https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/agile/agile_retros.html) article for  Stop/Start/Continue retro.

In the document, write down who your retro leader is.

At the end of the process, you should have in your document:
* Name of person leading the retro at the top, and a list of who participated
* A document with three parts, "stop/start/continue", and items from each member under the three categories
* Dot voting (three votes per team member participating) on the items in the document.
* A summary at the bottom on an "experiment" in the form "If we change X we hope to see Y result"
  - This should be related to one of the top three items by votes that your group agreed on.
* A brief explanation of how you will know whether your experiment was or was not a success.

# After the retro is done

* Ask a staff member to look over your GDrive document; they'll check it to make sure it has the required elements:
  - items from each member under start/stop/continue
  - dot voting
  - an experiment, including the criteria by which you can know whether the experiment was a success

# Next steps if there's more time

* Continue work on team02
* Start homework assignment [H01](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/m23/hwk/h01/) (Intro to JavaScript).
