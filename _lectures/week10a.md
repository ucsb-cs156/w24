If your team isn't yet at 100 points:

* Do a standup

# Today

# Final CATME survey, and the end of quarter post-survey

* You'll get a link to final CATME survey soon
* Link to post survey (for extra credit) will be showing up on Slack and Canvas soon.

If you did not fill out the pre-survey, but would still like to do so for extra credit,
and/or to offer your informed consent to allow us to use your data for research,
let me know via Slack DM and I'll send you the link. You can also find the pre-survey
link on the home page of the course on Canvas.

# Getting PRs merged

Let me encourage you to take the PR that's at the head of the queue (i.e. the oldest one for your team), and if it's in a mergeable state (i.e. passing CI/CD, has peer code review, no outstanding changes requested) then deploy it to your QA branch, with a post like this one:


# Merge Conflicts

Also, periodically, go through your PR queue (there's a link on each team's slack channel for convenience), and look at each PR for your team.  If you see this, then there are merge conflicts.

If you can, fix them yourself.  If you can't then mark the PR with the "merge conflicts" label, and ping the person on your team that can fix them.

# Out of date branches

If you see this:

Then click to update the branch:

All of this will help all of us get done with this final project (and the grading thereof) much more quickly!
