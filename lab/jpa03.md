{% include drop_down_style.html %}

This is an **individual** lab on the topic of deploying
Java web apps that use OAuth and Databases, using Dokku.

You may cooperate with one or more pair partners from your team to help in debugging and understanding the lab, but each person should complete the lab separately for themselves.

# Goal

By the end of this lab, you'll have deployed your own copy of the starter code repo (<{{page.starter}}>) on both localhost
and Dokku.  

This app is a full-stack web app with:

* A front-end built in React (under the directory `./frontend`)
* A back-end built in Spring Boot (the code for this is under the directory `./src`, plus the `pom.xml` at the top level
* OAuth integration; this allows the app to have a "login/logout" feature based on Google Accounts (e.g. your UCSB Google Account)
* A SQL database, which runs using H2 (an in-memory database) on localhost, and using Postgres when running on Dokku.

It is 

# Preliminaries

You'll need an environment where you can test this lab out on localhost before deploying.

* The best choice is your own laptop if you have one available
* The best known alternative is using Github Codespaces
* CSIL is not a good choice; you'll probably exceed your disk or file quota if you try.

For working on your own machine, you'll need the following:

* Java 17
* Maven
* git
* Heroku CLI
* Node 14
* npm 8.3

See guides for installing these on your machine at the links shown:

* Windows / WSL / Ubuntu: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/windows_wsl/>
* MacOS: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/macos/>

# Step 1: Understanding what we are trying to do

## What are we trying to accomplish in this lab?

This lab, similar to `jpa02` has little to no programming.  The point of the lab is to walk you through the steps you need to 
take to deploy full-stack Spring Boot/React apps on Dokku, configuring them for Google OAuth (for logins) and a Postgres database.

Unlike the simple "backend only" `Hello World` type app 
from jpa02, in this assignment, the app is a full-stack 
app with:


There are quite a few configuration steps that are needed,
and we want to get you used to those before we start
introducing the coding challenges as well.

# Step 2: Create your repo

You should already have a repo under the course organization 
<tt>{{page.github_org}}</tt> called 
<tt>{{page.num}}-<i>githubid</i></tt>
created for you by the staff, where <tt><i>github</i></tt> 
is your github id.

If not, create one for yourself following that naming convention;
it should initially be public, and empty (no `README`, license or
`.gitignore`.)

Clone that repo somewhere and cd into it.

Then add this remote:

<tt>git remote add starter {{page.starter}}</tt>

That sets up `starter` as a remote with the code from this github repo: <{{page.starter}}>

Then do:

```
git checkout -b main
git pull starter main
git push origin main
```

# Step 3: Configure your app for localhost as documented in the README.md

The next step is to read through the [README.md]({{page.starter}}/blob/main/README.md) and configure your app as indicated there.

This includes configuration for Google OAuth, and GitHub pages.

The configuration step includes copying the `.env.SAMPLE` file to `.env`.

The `.env` file  should *not* be committed to GitHub. 

The instruction to configure this app for OAuth are linked to from
the `README.md` in the starter repo itself, so will not repeat
them here.  Follow those instructions (which may, in turn, refer
you to instruction inside the `docs` folder of the repo.)

## The `.env` file  should *not* be committed to GitHub

I already made this point, but I really, really want to emphasize it.

One of the values in the `.env` file is called a client *secret* for a reason.  

If it leaks, it can be used for nefarious purposes to compromise the security of your account; so don't let it leak!

Never, ever, commit those to GitHub, and try to only share them in DMs on Slack (not in public channels).

Security starts with making smart choices about how to handle credentials and tokens. The stakes get higher when you start being trusted with credentials and tokens at an employer, so learning how to handle these with care now is a part of developing good developer habits.

The staff reserve the right to deduct points if we find that you have committed your `.env` file to GitHub.

## About OAuth

OAuth is a protocol that allows you to delegate the login/logout
functionality (user authentication) to a third party such as
Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, etc.  If you've ever used
a website that allows you to "Login with Google" or "Login With Facebook", then chances are good that app was built using OAuth.

Indeed, you've already encountered an examples of GitHub OAuth earlier in the course when you used your GitHub account to log into the <https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com>

## Follow the instructions in the README

The instructions in the README include instructions
for deploying to both localhost, and to Dokku.  

Follow those instructions, consulting the material below and the
material in jpa02 as needed, until you have the application
working on both localhost and Dokku.

You'll be following this sequence of instructions many
times during this course, so this assignment is here to help you get used to that process.

## Also set up GitHub Pages

In the file `docs/github-pages.md` there are instructions for setting up GitHub Pages to publish the documentation for this repo.  Follow these instructions.

## Green check ✅, not red X ❌

GitHub Actions should be running on the main branch with
a green check, not a red X.  If there are problems there,
address those as best you can before submitting.

## Reminder about running your web app on `localhost`

To get this demo app running on `localhost`, we need to do the following:

* Do the OAuth Configuration steps linked to from the README to get a `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` value
  and put them in your `.env` file
* Add your own UCSB email address, `phtcon@ucsb.edu`, and your mentors email (see <{{page.teams_url}})
* Add your own UCSB email address after `phtcon@ucsb.edu`, and your mentor's email (see <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f22/info/teams/>) separated by commas (no spaces) like this:
  
  ```
  ADMIN_EMAILS=phtcon@ucsb.edu,mentorsemail@ucsb.edu,youremail@ucsb.edu
  ```
  
  See also: <https://ucsb-cs156-f22.slack.com/archives/C03MHLM03TM/p1665530345235669>

* Then, use `mvn compile` to make sure that the code compiles.
* Next, try `mvn test` to be sure that the test cases pass.
* Then, run the following two commands separately in their own shells
  * In the first, launch the React frontend using `npm start` in the frontend directory. This should start the frontend on port 3000
  * In the second, launch the Spring Boot backend using `mvn spring-boot:run`.  This should start a web server on port 8080

The `mvn spring-boot:run` command is a shortcut that is provided for us to be able to run the jar file.  It does pretty much the same thing as 
if we ran the `.jar` file and specified the class containing our `main` on the command line.

When the app is up and running, try logging in with your UCSB Google Account.  

# Step 4: Create a new Heroku App using the Heroku CLI

In this step, we'll deploy our Spring Boot application to the public internet using Heroku.

As part of the setup instructions, you likely already set up a Heroku application
with the name <tt>{{page.num}}-<i>ucsbnetid</i></tt>.

You should now be able to link this app to your repo and deploy the `main` branch,
provided you did all the other setup steps correctly.

# What if it doesn't work?

If it doesn't work, consult the troubleshooting steps in `jpa02` and try them before asking a mentor, TA, or instructor for help.

# Step 5: Set up Storybook repos

Storybook is a utility that produces documentation sites for React Apps.

We are going to set up two separate repos that have the same name as your repo, but with the suffixes `-docs` and `-docs-qa`.

For example, if your GitHub id is `cgaucho`, you'll have a main repo:

* <tt>{{page.num}}-cgaucho</tt>

In this step, you'll create two additional repos:

* <tt>{{page.num}}-cgaucho-docs</tt>
* <tt>{{page.num}}-cgaucho-docs-qa</tt>

There is a script that you can try to run that should create these for you; the script is in the form of a "GitHub Action".

If the script works, great! (As of this writing, it was not working properly.) 

If not, you can create these two repos manually.

Instructions are under the `docs` directory in the file `storybook.md`.  Follow those instructions.

One step that isn't in the instructions:
* After you create the `-docs` and `-docs-qa` repos, you will need to click to create a `README.md` in order to
  establish the `main` branch, before you run the Github Actions scripts to populate the repos.
  
  Here's what that looks like:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/163060649-11b29e92-878f-4b3e-95d0-1d464d3450f6.png)
  
  Click where it says `README` to create a `README.md` file; *then* run the scripts.



When you are finished, update the links in the README.md file so that they point to your storybook repos:

Before:

```
* Production: <https://ucsb-cs156-f22.github.io/demo-spring-react-example-docs/storybook>
* QA:  <https://ucsb-cs156-f22.github.io/demo-spring-react-example-docs-qa/storybook>
```

After (with your URLs)

```
* Production: <https://ucsb-cs156-f22.github.io/jpa03-cgaucho-docs/>
* QA:  <https://ucsb-cs156-f22.github.io/jpa03-cgaucho-docs-qa/>
```

Make sure that the links work.

# Step 6: Submitting your work for grading

When you have a running web app, find the assignment jpa03 on Canvas and make a submission.

* There is no autograder for this assignment on Gradescope!
* This assignment will be manually graded
* Please make it easy for the staff by making clickable URLs in your Canvas submission.

In the text area, enter something like this, substituting your repo name and your Heroku app name:

<div style="font-family:monospace;">
repo name: https://github.com/{{page.org}}/{{page.num}}-chrislee123<br><br>
on heroku: https://{{page.num}}-chrislee123.herokuapp.com<br>
</div>

Then, **and this is super important**, please make both of those URLs **clickable urls**.


# Grading Rubric:

* (20 pts) Basic Logistics
  - Having a repo with the correct name in the correct organization with the starter code for this lab
  - There is a post on Canvas for this assignment that has the correct content
  - The links on Canvas are clickable links (to make it easier to test your app)
  - README has a link to your repo.
* (20 pts) Having a running web app at <tt>https://{{page.num}}-<i>ucsbnetid</i>.herokuapp.com</tt>
* (20 pts) Running web app has the ability to login with OAuth through a Google Account.
* (20 pts) Storybooks for `docs` and `docs-qa` are both set up properly.
* (20 pts) GitHub Actions runs correctly and there is a green check (not a red X) on your main branch

Note that the Rubric above is subject to change, but if it does:
* You'll be notified during a class meeting 
* You'll have an additional week from the date of the announced change to get your repo in shape with the new requirements.
